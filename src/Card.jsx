      <p>My Dearest Maluf,</p>
      <p>
        Happy Birthday to the love of my life! ðŸŽ‚ðŸŽ‰ <br />
        On your special day, I want to celebrate the amazing woman you are -
        inside and out. You are my heart, my partner, and the one who makes my
        life complete. I can't imagine a future without you by my side, and I am
        so grateful to share this journey with you. <br className="mt"/>
        As we step closer to forever together, I can't help but feel excited for
        all the incredible memories yet to come. Thank you for being the person
        you are, you make my life richer and fuller just by being in it. Wishing
        you a day as amazing as you are, filled with love, laughter, and
        everything that makes you smile.
        <br />I also want to take this moment to say sorry. I know there have
        been times when I haven't put in the effort I should have, and for that,
        I am truly sorry. You deserve so much more than I've given, and I want
        you to know that I am committed to doing better every day because you deserve
        the best.
        <br />
        <br />I love you infinity.
