      <p>My Dearest Maluf,</p>
      <p>
        Happy Birthday to the love of my life! ðŸŽ‰ <br />
        On your special day, I want to remind you how incredibly lucky I am to
        have you by my side. You light up my world since the day we met, and
        every moment with you is a gift I cherish. As we step closer to forever
        together, I can't help but feel excited for all the incredible memories
        yet to come. Thank you for being the person you are â€” you make my life
        richer and fuller just by being in it. Here's to celebrating you today
        and always. I love you more than words can express.
      </p>
      <p className="name">Forever yours, FðŸ’–</p>
